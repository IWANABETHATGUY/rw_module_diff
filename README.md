# Usage 
1. Replacing `examples/rspack.js` with your rspack chunk file
2. Replacing `examples/webpack.js` with your webpack chunk file
3. Noticed that, these two file should be corresponded.
4. `node src/index.js`
5. Then it will generate something like this:
```
./a/c.js: # each line start without `[`, means the module generated by rspack has something different compare to webpack
 ["test"] # if the next line started with `[`, it means rspack generated these exports but webpack didn't
./a/index.js: # if the next line is a new module id, it means rspack generated this module but webpack didn't
./a/lib.js:
```
